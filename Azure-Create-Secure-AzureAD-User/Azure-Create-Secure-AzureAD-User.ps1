.SYNOPSIS
Creates a user in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) with comprehensive error handling and security considerations.

.DESCRIPTION
This script connects to Azure, prompts for user information, creates a user in Azure AD, and assigns a password meeting complexity requirements. It incorporates error handling and best practices for secure user creation.

.NOTES
Requires Az.Accounts module for Azure cmdlets.

Secure Password Handling: Use of ConvertTo-SecureString to convert the generated password into a secure string before adding it to the user object. This is a good practice as it avoids storing plain text passwords in the script.
Additional User Properties: Use of AccountEnabled property set to $true (enabled) and sets ForceChangePasswordNextLogin to $true within the PasswordProfile. This forces the user to change their password upon first login.
New-AzADUser Parameters: Use of a hashtable (@newUserParams) to define user properties and the password profile, providing a cleaner way to structure the object creation.
