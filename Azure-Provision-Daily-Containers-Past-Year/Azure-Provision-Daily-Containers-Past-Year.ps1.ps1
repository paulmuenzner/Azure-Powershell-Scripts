$startDate = (Get-Date).AddYears(-1)
$endDate = Get-Date

# Create resource group (if it doesn't exist)
New-AzResourceGroup -Name $resourceGroup -Location $location -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Create storage account with system-assigned managed identity
New-AzStorageAccount -Name $storageAccountName -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Location $location -SkuName Standard_LRS -Kind StorageV2 -Identity (New-AzIdentity)

# Loop through each day in the last year
foreach ($date in (Get-Date ($startDate)..$endDate)) {
  $containerName = $date.ToString("yyyyMMdd")
  New-AzStorageContainer -Context (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -Name $storageAccountName) -Name $containerName
